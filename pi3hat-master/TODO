 * Support configuring CAN devices
 * Report CAN state and error flags

 * In one instance, saw the CAN stm32 get hung in some way that caused
   _tool -r to run very slow and use the timeout, despite single
   instance appearing to get all the responses

 * add "stored procedure" sends, so that all the queries to all
   servos, for instance can be sent with a 1 byte SPI command.

DONE 2020-11-17
 * Switched regulator to MAX17504
   * changed inductor to meet its guidelines
 * Removed microphone
 * Added connector with 3V and 5V power
 * Added VIN sense resistor connected to aux processor

DONE 2020-06-12
 * Implemented DMA
 * Troubleshooted timing irregularities

DONE 2020-06-11
 * Tested on full 4 buses

DONE 2020-06-10
 * Got RF working in a basic way
 * Implemented many features

DONE 2020-06-09
 * r4.2 bringup
   * Switching to optimized protocol and resolving all TODOs

DONE 2020-04-23
 * r4.1 bringup
   * Verified primary CAN, IMU, and NRF
   * Verified aux CAN
   * Verified IRQ lines
   * Microphone

DONE 2020-03-28
 * Implemented NRF protocol

DONE 2020-03-22
 * r4.1
   * Switched out aux CAN for the LTC2875 to get better common mode
   * Stopped populating NRF header
   * get the pi header into PCBA (so mirror all the pins and flip it to
     the bottom of the board)
   * Connect some pins from each uc to GPIOs on the rpi for IRQ or other
     general purpose
   * expose some random STM32 pins, especially on the AUX STM32 on pin
     headers w/ gnd
   * expose some random pi GPIOs on pin headers w/ gnd
   * added microphone to aux processor
 * NRF
   * add a solid ground fill under the board on the top layer, maybe
     with a few mounting holes to add more support hw
   * add more filtering to NRF power supply... perhaps a LC filter of
     some sort and a bigger decoupling cap
   * think harder about NRF antenna placement options, turning it
     around to face the other side of the board would allow the
     antenna to be away from all the other cables, but soldering
     directly to the board could interfere with other connectors

DONE 2020-03-04
 * Implemented accelerometer rejection for dynamic maneuvers
 * Implemented a term to keep the yaw bias uncertainty in check
 * Tuned constants a tiny bit
 * Diagnosed SPI timing problem and improved things

DONE 2020-03-03
 * Implemented AHRS

DONE 2020-03-01
 * got eeprom settings into git
 * Verified NRF works

DONE 2020-02-29
 * Verified IMU works

DONE 2020-02-28
 * add mjbots logo
 * Add debug pads to each processor

DONE 2020-01-29
 * route power
 * route SPI
 * route CAN
 * selected parts
 * route everything else
 * fine fix silks

DONE 2020-01-28
 * Fixed up stm32 pinouts
 * renumber caps
 * renumber resistors
 * renumber diodes
 * add overvoltage protection tvs
 * fine place all components
 * rough silks
 * route planes

r3 DONE
 * Added pullup to RT8299 EN

r2 ERRATA
 * RT8299 EN needs a 100k pullup to VIN

# r1 #

* R1 is 10.5k instead of 105k
